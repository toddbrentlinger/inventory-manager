X Add Brand model and field in Item. Could then filter by brand.
Ex. filter all tools in tool inventory group with brand Dewalt.

- Instead of having RecipientActionItem abstract class with many 
different child classes, have RecipientActionItem concrete class 
with CharField with choices of 'borrowed', 'gifted', 'sold', etc.
Single Item should only have ONE RecipientActionItem.
Issue: Extra fields in sub-classes. Ex. return_promise_date in
'borrowed items' and price_sold 'sold items'.

- Instead of Price model, store price as American dollar cents and 
inside User model, have a Currency field that is used to convert base 
price in model to user selected currency.
